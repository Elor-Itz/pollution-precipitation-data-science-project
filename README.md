<h1> THE RELATION BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION AND PRECIPITATION</h1>


<h2>THE RESEARCH </h2>
Checking if there is a relation between the levels of NOx concentration and the volumes of precipitation.


<h2> ACQUIRING THE DATA </h2>
<li><strong>Pollution data from the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection</strong> (Scraping using Selenium)</li>
<li><strong>Precipitation data from the Israeli Meteorological Service</strong> (manual download)</li>


<h2> CLEANING THE DATA </h2>
<li>Removing irrelevant columns</li>
<li>Translating station names to English</li>
<li>Filling missing data</li>
<li>Concatenating the two dataframes into one</li>


<h2> ANALYZING THE DATA </h2>
Exploring various graphs to learn about the data and look for relations between air pollution and precipitation.


<h2> MACHINE LEARNING </h2>
<li><strong>Supervised learning:</strong> A logistic regression model - Will the given day be rainy or dry?</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> Kmeans Clustering</li>
